Not sure what's causing it, but they're pretty frustrating. They occur randomly in-game, but the game also has a bad tendency to crash out of even a menu.\\r Additionally the game runs really poorly on my hardware to begin with. I'm running an i7-4790 with 780ti SLI on an SSD, all my drivers are updated, and I've got patch 1.2 installed and it still runs terribly on even the lowest settings. It's not even so much that I see a low framerate -- Even though I certainly do, I'm averaging about 35 fps overall on medium settings -- It's that the framerate fluctuates wildly for seemingly no reason. For example, I'll play through a certain area and see around 45 fps, then quick reload because I screwed something up, and play through the same exact area averaging 28 fps. It makes no sense. And toggling graphics settings seems to help nothing: I get maybe a 5 fps variance between the lowest settings and putting everything to high. Something is severely wrong with this game, and seeing how broken it is removes almost all of my hope that it'll ever be fixed. From what I understand it even runs poorly on consoles: I've seen many complaints about crashes on the PS4. So maybe this is a Void Engine thing, I dunno. But I sure wish they had just built Dishonored 2 on the Unreal Engine, like Dishonored 1 was.\\r The poor performance and terrible overall stability make this game almost completely unplayable even on super high-end systems: Even people running 1080s are experiencing frame drops and instability, so you can't even brute force your way into hitting a constant, stable 60 fps. As for the crashes, who knows? They could be caused by any number of reasons.\\r All-in-all this is the worst running PC game I've played since Assassin's Creed Unity's release back in 2014. I've heard people say this is as bad as Arkham Knight, though I can't say whether or not that's true since I haven't played that one. I'll update my review should this game ever stabilize, though even that is no guarantee. Once a game releases in this bad of shape it's rare to ever see it run well again.\\r Now we know why Bethesda didn't want to ship review copies to journalists covering the game. Because it barely works. Shame on you Bethesda for such shady business practices, and shame on you for releasing a game with so much potential in such a sorry state.\\r Note: I'll edit this review if it ever manages to run decently, but for now I don't really have anything to comment on aside from its performance since it's nearly unplayable in its current state.\"),\n",

       "  'I played the original Dishonored and loved it – even played through a second time to get the low chaos ending. Bought the DLCs and loved them. So I’m coming into Dishonored 2 with high expectations. And I’m feeling let down. Here are my thoughts, in no particular order:\\r •\\tFirst off, I’m playing on a Windows 10 machine with a Core i5 and a GTX-970. I’m through chapter 6 and I’ve had one crash and noticed a few minor graphic anomalies like walking around a corner and seeing a wall appear, but that’s it. Nothing that really impacts playability.\\r •\\tI’m playing as Emily (as I’m guessing many are since we played as Corvo in the first game). I’m not enthralled with her powers. Outside of her Far Reach, Dark Vision, and Domino, I’m not using much. I’ve done the Shadow Walk once or twice, but I probably could have accomplished the goal with Far Reach as well (and the animation when you knock someone out with Shadow Walk power is just freaky – as in make me cringe freaky).\\r •\\tI’m going for low chaos, so all the powers about killing and more health, strength and shadow kill are wasted on me.\\r •\\tThe world feels empty. Yes, there are now people on the streets in some places, but they don’t really do anything – they just stand there and shadow box or saw wood. In fact I find it annoying because I can’t tell who is an innocent and who will try to attack me until I interact with them.\\r •\\tI hate the hub – the Dreadful Whale. D1 had the Hound Pits pub, which 1) had several people around that gave the place a sense of life, and 2) was a great playground to try out abilities. I could practice blink-racing across the area, or see how high I could climb and get a good feel for how to manipulate my powers. I’ve tried a few times to get to the top of the mast and stand on the little platform up there but I fail every time. Bummer. I also enjoyed the rivalry between Piero and Sokolov in D1 and watching that play out, but I haven’t found any “life” like that in this game.\\r •\\t*** SPOILERS **** There are some collectables that seem really oddly placed. In D1 I recall that there were multiple paths to get anywhere. In D2, for example there is this rune in the basement of the Asylum that you can only get to by taking the elevator to the top and then cutting the cables to send it crashing into the basement – neither obvious nor stealthy. There is another one in a locked room in the basement of the Conservatory that you need to find a key for. In D1 I’d expect a rat-tunnel or window transom as an alternate path.\\r •\\tHate the new Dark Vision. With the orange on orange is really hard to see what’s what. D1 did this much better.\\r •\\tFinicky Controls – Far Reach and it’s pull are really hard to aim right. There seems to be a really small window when aiming that will get you “up” on something. As an example, I was working my way across the Conservatory level and ended up on the spinning light tower in the middle. I could see the balcony I wanted to get to. I walked out on the end of the “gangplank” and as the tower was spinning there was a small window of time where I was close enough to make the leap. But I could never get the aim right. After about 10 failures I gave up and found an alternate path.\\r •\\tLack of feedback when your actions affect the world. As an example, there is one area that requires you to walk across pressure plates to move some walls. I was seeing the walls moving but had no idea I was making it happen. It took some research online to understand what was happening. After I knew that, looking down at my “feet” (which aren’t really there) I could see the plate depress when I “step” on it, but if I’m not looking at the floor I never would have seen that. An audible click would have helped immensely to let me know at I just did something.\\r •\\tOverall feeling of sadness. In D1 I was Corvo, wrongly accused of murdering the Empress and thrown in jail, only to escape and work with a band of crusaders to overthrow those responsible. In D2 I’m Emily, my throne has been usurped and I’ve been thrown in my room, only to escape and … slink off to another city to try to uncover the backstory of my usurper, all the while spending my down time in a rusty stinky hulk of a ship.\\r There are more things that bug me, but that’s enough to give you a feel for it. In the end I’ll finish the game to see how the story plays out, and then shelve it. Very doubtful I’ll replay it or get any DLCs if they come out.'),\n",

So after being relegated to my second choice of resolution of 1440p, I expect normally 60fps with a few drops here and there. But to drop below 20fps has led me to create a new metacritic account just to be another one of those users who score a game 0. Normally I get frustrated at 0 scores as they aren't really rating the game but the optimisation. But even when dropping the game to 1080p these drops occurred.

Graphics are probably worse than many Triple A games such as like Deus Ex, Witcher or MGS but they obviously are not the worst and I didn't have any problems with Dishonored 2's visuals (except some animation problems) or I haven't faced with any bugs yet.\\r The worst thing about the game is probably the ending and differences between Emily and Corvo (at least for me.)

Both of Low and High Chaos endings felt lame to me at the first sight. In fact Emily Kaldwin and Corvo Attano are pretty same.

I have two computers one old one new and both can now run the game smoothly if you take take the time to adjust graphics settings properly. On the new computer (nvidia 1050 ti) the game looks very good with very high texture quality. On the old one it looks satisfying and still runs smoothly. So the review will be based on game play rather than technical issues.\\r The problem with this game is that it employs RPG mechanics (various perks that improve your character) while being very different from typical RPG games. An RPG game will reward you for all the standard activities you do in the game: fighting, discovering new locations and completing quests. You can then use the experienced gained to improve you character. In this game doing all these things gives you nothing, literally nothing. You can go through successive missions with only minimal increase in your character capabilities until you reach the situation when the further progress is impossibly hard because you are simply too weak. In a standard RPG game you can then change your quest, go elsewhere, farm experience and return when you are ready. But not here. Dishonored 2 is in fact a strictly linear game where you go from A to B to C ... and you can never return to previous locations once you finished them. It is even worse than that. Whenever you reach an essential quest location (typically a large building) you will be locked there until you finish the quest. No chance for extra farming at all. And the farming consists in looking for runes which are dispersed all over the world in hidden locations that have nothing to do at all with doing any questsl. So you will have to waste your time scavanging empty building or sewers just to find runes without which you will not be able to play at a decent power level. But you will only learn that this is so maybe 2-3 missions into the future when there will be no coming back and the only option will be to restard the campaign. I find such design tiresome and a pointless waste of time.\\rAs to the combat it would be interesting and challenging if it were not for the fact that the loading times after getting killed are atrocious. And you will die over and over again if you try to fight your way (especially when being undefarmed) because you die after receiving just 2 hits and multiple opponents will wield pistols. Then there are clockwork soldiers that are totally immune to all your basic attacks. They are essentially invincible. They are in fact 2x worse than deathclaws in Fallout as deathclaws can be beaten even with basic weapons if you have the skill and patience. But the clockwork soldiers just take zero damage from your attacks. Fun like hell. After dying like 20 times to them in a locked room and fighting for 10 seconds and reloading 1 minute each time I called it quits. I will restart the campaign and try again developing my character more carefully but I am not sure if I will want to waste my time crawling in sewers which have nothing to do with the main quest. So this is a strictly linear game with shallow rpg mechanics that forces you to waste your time on boring activities detached from the story and quests. 7 is the resulting score.'),\n",

A 4 year old ps3 game\\rthe game starts out with you conveniently training the now Empress Emily on being an assassin…\\rIt introduces new ideas and mechanics to the dishonored series like sliding and jumping... but you use none of this throughout the campaign…\\rEmilys Aunt comes to take her place on the throne and its then you choose who you play as, Corvo from Dishonored 1 or the Emperess Emily,\\rI chose Emily as she introduces a new set of magic to the game…\\rAnd you have to save whoever you don’t choose and retake the crown…\\rYour choice does not change the campaign, but will of course change the story.. So there is incentive to play twice...\\rWhich unfortunately if you want to feel you got your moneys worth youll have to do as my run through with Emily took only about 5 hours and 40 minutes…\\rNothing has really changes since dishonored 1, except level design got noticeably worse…\\rThere are 2 levels that are pretty cool puzzles that will definitely test your patience, but these 2 levels are the only 2 of the 9 that live up to this series standards..\\rThe rest all feel uninspired, and therefore I felt no urge to explore them…\\rAnd creating such boring worlds to explore is bad for the player and hurts the gameplay because of how inaccessible magic and upgrades are in this game…\\rIf you aren’t willing to try and figure out how to get to a rune behind some annoying locked door.. you’re not going to have fun at all playing this game as upgrades and magic are so expensive and are mistakenly not unlocked with story progress…\\rI felt the same about the original.. But it’s even worse here due to how inaccessible everything is...\\rMagic should be given to you as you progress through the story and the level design should be crafted around this magic…\\rThere is an option to do a no magic run here as Emily, but even still… theres potential to turn this into 3 different campaigns centered around each characters magic or lack there of…\\rInstead theyd rather annoy you by hiding the runes in frustrating spots like they don’t want you to have fun with their game..\\rWell congrats Bethesda, you win...\\rI didn’t have fun at all…\\rUpgrades are also only available at shops… and for ridiculous prices that you won’t be able to afford unless again, you spend the time to explore these poorly designed levels with horrible progression indication…\\rI understand the whole point of dishonored is to place you in a world and let you go..\\rBut there should still be some sort of direction designed into the world…\\rFor example one of the later missions I was stuck in a room forever trying to leave, only to google and find out everyone else had problems with this spot to… there was a button next to the door you were supposed to hit.. The game never tells you to look for a button to proceed, it just gives you a locked door... and it’s a Bethesda game so naturally one would assume, this is a bug... no... Just bad design.\\rThe hand to hand combat here is just as bad as it was in the original, now however there are ways to just knock enemies out instead of killing them in combat which makes a non-lethal run much easier to obtain, but the stealthy approach is still the more satisfying option…\\rDishonored 2 is everything we already got…\\rSneak around, take people out, get detected and sword fight or gun fight…\\rDisable electric walls A dash of magic  all in a less inspired world… with like 1 and a half hours of awesomeness from 2 levels.\\rSet your standards low… It’s nowhere near as good as the original.\\rI Give Dishonored 2\\ra 5.5/10'),\n",

Also, for those of you that do have problems, the game likes to set its priority to low after each loading screen, so changing it to normal or above should do the trick until there's a patch. Now, onto the review.\\r The first Dishonored is my favorite game of all time. Obviously, I was anxious for the day to come where I could reprise my role as Royal Protector Corvo Attano, or I could possess the role of Empress Emily Kaldwin, whom has a slew of new abilities. As of now, I am around 10 hours into my playthrough as Emily and I must say that this is exactly what I expected from this sequel. Of course, there are multiple ways of reaching your target and also multiple ways to take down your target. Each power now has a more in-depth upgrade tree in which you can allow Corvo's Blink to be redirective, as Daud's was in the Knife of Dunwall and the Brigmore Witches, or you can upgrade Emily's Doppleganger ability to create copies of yourself that will fight for you.\\r A new feature that I was very excited for was Bonecharm Crafting. This works by sacrificing a bone charm's trait so that you will be able to create a single bone charm with multiple traits taken from a sacrificed charm. You can create a single charm with two, three, or four traits, however, corrupted charms have made a reappearance from Daud's DLC. The more traits you add onto a crafted bone charm, the more likely it will be come corrupted and apply a negative attribute along with the traits you applied to it.\\r I don't know much about graphics, but I can tell you that this game's graphics are outstanding. I will occasionally stop and stare at the scenery, which will sometimes appear as a beautiful painting. The art style has remained the same and it helps with its look that much more.\\r There are new enemies, such as the Nest Keepers and the Clockwork Soldiers that will help gameplay from feeling repetitive. There are new faces, as well as old ones. There are new powers that can be heavily upgraded (if you can find the resources to do so), and old ones with new attributes to be added onto them. There's an entirely new system for bone charms that can be ignored if you do not care for corrupted charms. There are new places to explore, and there are old, but familiar ones that make this sequel feel that much more like Dishonored.\\r This game has gotten a lot of criticism for its performance, but looking past this minor inconvenience, Dishonored 2 is yet another masterpiece created by the masterminds at Arkane Studios. In my opinion, Dishonored 2 is hands-down my Game of the Year and I would recommend this piece of art to each and every one of you.\"),\n",

Not only does it have a good story to play through that you can learn more from just picking up and reading all the different documents laying around, but the gameplay is outstanding and so entertaining.  I have been playing on very hard the whole time and I am close to the end of the game. Now, I will say like the first it was very frustrating in the beginning when you had barely any abilities at your disposal.  Although, that all changes and you can easily adapt yourself to the way you want to play.  I tried the nonlethal approach for a bit and loved the challenge, but once I started gaining powers from collecting the runes it all changed fast. Eliminating unaware guards could never get old and there are so many ways to do it.  So what if I have a high chaos ending at least it was fun the whole time and still quite the challenge at my difficulty setting. Lastly, I really despise people that leave reviews of games and give it awful scores because of their own hardware issues or FPS issue that will be patched.  I purposely waited until the issues were resolved with updates and driver updates until I made an educated decision about this review.  I will even say I had FPS issues with my combine GTX 970 SSC and GTX 670 (Dedicated PhysX GPU) running the game. Now, I am running the game on ultra settings and I have zero issues. So hopefully this is helpful because regardless I think this has a really good chance of being Game of the Year.'),\n",
